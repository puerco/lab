    description: >
      If an attacker is able to intercept certain requests to the Kubelet, they
      can send a redirect response that may be followed by a client using the
      credentials from the original request. This can lead to compromise of
      other nodes.
      
      If multiple clusters share the same certificate authority trusted by the
      client, and the same authentication credentials, this vulnerability may
      allow an attacker to redirect the client to another cluster. In this
      configuration, this vulnerability should be considered High severity.
