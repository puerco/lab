# Changelog since v1.18.0

## Important Security Information

This release contains changes that address the following vulnerabilities:

### CVE-2020-8555: Half-Blind SSRF in kube-controller-manager

There exists a Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in kube-controller-manager that allows certain authorized users to leak up to 500 bytes of arbitrary information from unprotected endpoints within the master's host network (such as link-local or loopback services). An attacker with permissions to create a pod with certain built-in Volume types (GlusterFS, Quobyte, StorageOS, ScaleIO) or permissions to create a StorageClass can cause kube-controller-manager to make GET requests or POST requests without an attacker controlled request body from the master's host network.
